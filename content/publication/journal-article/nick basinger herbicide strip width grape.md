abstract: "In the eastern United States, high rainfall and humidity promote excessive vine growth and immense pest pressure for Vitis vinifera production. Improved canopy characteristics could increase fruit quality by reducing pest pressure, by increasing soluble solids and total anthocyanin concentrations, and by improving the balance between pH and titratable acidity (TA). Increasing competition for water and nutrients during the growing season (by narrowing the VFS or allowing late-season weed competition) may be an effective way to accomplish these improvements. In this study, narrower VFS width in a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea var. ‘Kentucky 31’) groundcover reduced vine vegetative growth and positively influenced berry composition. Vineyard weed populations that established naturally postveraison did not affect vine size, yield, or fruit quality."
