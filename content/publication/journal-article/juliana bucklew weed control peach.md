abstract: "Field experiments were conducted in North Carolina to determine peach response to herbicides. Mesotrione, rimsulfuron, and sulfentrazone did not injure newly planted peach trees. However, halosulfuron at the higher rate caused injury to peach trees, but did not reduce tree cross-sectional area or winter pruning weight. Another field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of herbicide-based programs on weed control. Sulfentrazone alone controlled common lambâ€™s-quarters and henbit but provided poor control of large crabgrass and yellow foxtail. However, a tank mix of norflurazon or oryzalin with sulfentrazone improved control of these weeds over sulfentrazone alone. Terbacil alone or in tank mix rimsulfuron, and flumioxazin alone gave excellent control of large crabgrass and yellow foxtail."
