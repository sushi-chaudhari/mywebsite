I am an assistant professor in the Department of Horticulutre at Michigan State University. My research interests include integrated weed management, herbicide efficacy and carryover, crop tolerance to herbicides, crop/weed competition, weed biology, and mechanisms of herbicide resistance. My lab's main focus is weed management in specialty crops.
